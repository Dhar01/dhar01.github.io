# Service management

```bash
sudo systemctl start app.service

sudo systemctl stop app.service

sudo systemctl restart app.service

sudo systemctl reload app.service

sudo systemctl reload-or-restart app.service

sudo systemctl enable app.service

sudo systemctl disable app.service
```

### Checking status

```bash
systemctl status app.service

systemctl is-active app.service

systemctl is-enabled app.service

systemctl is-failed app.service
```

### System state overview

```bash
# see a list of active units
systemctl list-units

systemctl # returns same as above

systemctl list-units --all

systemctl list-units --all --state=inactive

systemctl list-units --type=service
```

To see every available units in the system paths (*including those that `systemd` has not attempted to load*):

```bash
systemctl list-unit-files
```

The state:

- `enabled`
- `disabled`
- `static`: means that the unit files does not contain an `install` section, which is used to enable a unit.
- `masked`:

# Unit management

### Show a unit file

To display the unit file that `systemd` has loaded into the system:

```bash
systemctl cat app.service
```

### Display dependencies

To see a unit's dependency tree:

```bash
systemctl list-depnedencies app.service
```

### Using shortcuts for important events

Put the system into rescue (*single-user*) mode:

```bash
sudo systemctl rescue
```

To halt the system:

```bash
sudo systemctl halt
```

To initiate a full shutdown:

```bash
sudo systemctl poweroff
```

For restart:

```bash
sudo systemctl reboot
```

### Listing available targets

A list of the available targets:

```bash
systemctl list-unit-files --type=target
```

Unlike runlevels, multiple targets can be active at one time. An active target indicates that `systemd` has attempted to start all of the units tied to the target and has not tried to tear them down again.

To see all of the active targets:

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=target
```

### Default target

To find the default target for system:

```bash
systemctl get-default
```

To set different default target:

```bash
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
```

### Editing unit files

Edit unit file:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit app.service
```

This will be a blank file that can be used to override or add directives to the unit definition. A directory will be created within the `/etc/systemd/system` directory which contains the name of the unit with .d appended. For instance, for the `nginx.service`, a directory called `nginx.service.d` will be created.

Within this directory, a snippet will be created called override.conf. When the unit is loaded, `systemd` will, in memory, merge the override snippet with the full unit file. The snippetâ€™s directives will take precedence over those found in the original unit file.

To edit the full unit file instead of creating a snippet:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit --full nginx.service
```

After editing, deleting file or directory:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Check unit properties

To see the low-level properties of a unit:

```bash
systemctl show app.service
```

To see the conflicts:

```bash
systemctl show app.service -p conflicts
```

### Masking or unmasking units

```bash
sudo systemctl mask app.service
```

To mark a unit as completely unstartable, automatically or manually, by linking it to /dev/null, we can mask the unit.

To unmask:

```bash
sudo systemctl unmask app.service
