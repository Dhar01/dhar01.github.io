Hello there, and welcome! üëã

It's Loknath, a guy behind this blog and a backend-focused software engineer passionate about tech, writing codes for both - humans and machines, books, the sea and a scouser by heart.

This blog is about different aspects of software engineering and technology in general, as I don't believe in *the best programming language/paradigm* concepts. I do have some preferences, as I feel being myself with Golang and Linux.

I enjoy exploring system design, databases, and API design.
