# 👋 Hey there

I’m **Loknath**, a Linux enthusiast who bleeds Liverpool RED on matchday! Trying to be a programmer with Golang, also an infrequent writer. I enjoy cinema, and anime, can’t live without songs, and buy more books than I read. I feel like dancing on the occasion of playing Fifa, sometimes craving for the smell and sounds of rain, and most of the time, my favorite keyboard.

In the daytime, ~~I would love to see myself as a storyteller~~, but in reality, I am passing my days working on my skills to build a career as Jr. DevOps Engineer. One special thing about me if you ask, I don't know much about operating a Windows system. Always had a Linux heart beating inside me!

Fear not! I may not be a *go-to-help-for-windows-system* type of guy, but hey, I'm open for some DevOps, InfoSec, Golang moments! Everything will be much better if you're a Football fan, just drop me a line over [telegram](https://t.me/Dhar01), I'm about always available there!

Nice to meet you!
